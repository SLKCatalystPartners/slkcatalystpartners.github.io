Deep market understanding, effective customer targeting, optimizing salesforce performance, and competitive strategy.

# Strategic Market Leadership

- Deeply understand market dynamics, customer needs, and competitive landscape.
- Develop effective segmentation, targeting, and positioning strategies.
- Optimize salesforce performance with the right metrics and incentives.
- Manage competition using strategic and tactical approaches.
- Implement robust market research to inform strategic decisions.

## Toolkit 22: Managing the big picture of the marketplace

- Develop a comprehensive understanding of your market
- Create a strong positioning strategy for your company
- Align all aspects of your marketing approach

We will work with managers to ingrain the big picture of market-focused discipline: (i) Deeply understanding the company, the customer, and the competitor; (ii) Developing a robust Segmentation-Targeting-Positioning strategy; and (iii) Developing a well-coordinated marketing mix of the 4 Ps---product, price, place, and promotion/branding

## Toolkit 23: Achieving a deep understanding of customers

- Gain insights into your customers' needs and wants
- Improve your marketing effectiveness
- Develop products and services that truly meet customer needs

We will work with managers to obtain a deep understanding of their customers and their needs, including their unarticulated needs and needs that they don't know they have. We will work through the triad of customer behavior to ensure the marketing initiatives are hitting the right notes:

- Getting customer attention
- Getting into customer memory
- Understanding and influencing customer choice

We will also recommend specific market research approaches and tools to implement to better understand customers and the marketplace.

## Toolkit 24: Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning Decisions

- Identify the most profitable customer groups for your business
- Focus your marketing efforts more effectively
- Set your company apart from competitors

We will revisit the segmentation, targeting, and positioning decisions of the firm. First, is the firm using the best bases for segmentation? Often, firms demarcate market segments based solely on demographic variables (e.g., customer income or firm size). But almost always, demarcating segments using a combination of demographic and behavioral variables works better. We will seek to integrate dimensions that make the segmentation more effective.

Following that, we will examine the targeting decision. A common cause of business failure is trying to be too much to too many customer types. We will evaluate the temporal trajectory of targeting, ensuring that the marketing resources are tightly focused on a key beachhead segment before diversifying the marketing effort.

Finally, we will visit the positioning decision to evaluate whether the firm has clearly positioned itself so that is seen as delivering a clear, differential competitive advantage compared to competitors. If needed, we can construct a perceptual map using customer perceptions of the company and its competitors so that managers get a clear idea about how are viewed by customers. Often, this understanding can be a key driver of marketing and corporate strategy.

## Toolkit 25: Salesforce management

- Improve your sales team's performance
- Design effective compensation plans for salespeople
- Encourage teamwork and knowledge sharing among sales staff

We will audit salesforce performance within the company, advising on how salesforce performance can be optimized using the right performance metrics that induce strong performance without invoking "gaming" of the metrics, the right kinds of compensation plans that incorporate individual and group performance components, and inducing helping and knowledge-sharing behaviors across the salesforce members.

## Toolkit 26: Managing the competition

- Develop strategies to outperform your competitors
- Learn how to handle price wars effectively
- Use game theory to make better strategic decisions

Companies must deeply understand and actively manage their competition. We will work with managers on conceptually rich yet highly practical game theoretic tools that can be employed to manage the competition including signaling, preemption, credible commitment, and the timing of strategic moves. We will also coach managers on how to fight price wars well by avoiding making price the focus of competition and by using "fighting brands."
