Generating innovative ideas, enhancing customer experiences, expanding services, building sustainable models, and managing disruptive innovations.

# Unleashing Potential for Growth

- Encourage diverse and systematic innovation across all business dimensions.
- Enhance customer experiences to foster loyalty and profitability.
- Expand and reconfigure services to meet customer needs more effectively.
- Implement sustainable business models integrating environmental goals.
- Use brainstorming and value management to generate actionable, high-ROI ideas.

## Toolkit 1: The innovation radar

- Discover new ways to innovate across your entire business
- Generate a mix of quick wins and big ideas for growth
- Ensure you're not missing any easy opportunities to improve

This toolkit focuses on understanding the different "kinds" of innovation. By systematically considering each dimension of innovation, managers can generate an inventory comprising a mix of low-hanging and more ambitious ideas for execution. Apart from surface some interesting and usable ideas for long-term growth, applying this toolkit systematically ensures that no easy, high-ROI opportunities along any of the 12 dimensions of innovation are overlooked.

## Toolkit 2: Microinnovation: Customer-focused innovation and growth

- Improve your customers' overall experience with your company
- Identify ways to keep customers loyal and increase profits
- Use technology to enhance customer interactions cost-effectively

This toolkit focuses on innovating to create great end-to-end customer experiences. Such experiences are critical to increasing enterprise value today. Research clearly indicates that growing business from satisfied and loyal existing customers is far more profitable than fighting for new customers. This toolkit can help map the entire the customer experience and challenge what the company is doing at each point of the customer experience, leading to a portfolio of ideas that can enhance the customer experience, thus generating customer loyalty and profitability. In addition, by replacing and enhancing existing touchpoints with technology-driven solutions, companies can often create a better customer experience at a lower cost.

## Toolkit 3: Service innovation A: Seeking opportunities for service growth

- Find new ways to grow your service offerings
- Understand and address your customers' needs better
- Improve existing services to stand out from competitors

This toolkit offers a way to seek service growth through the lens of customer needs and the activities they undertake to address those needs. To address their needs, customers typically engage in activities related to a *core* activity chain (e.g., finding a home to buy) and *secondary* activity chains (e.g., financing the home). Service *expansion* involves adding new service activities that add customer value. Service *reconfiguration* involves taking over activities that customers do and doing it for them better than they can themselves. Depending on the locus of the service growth, we will advise on growth initiatives in four domains---*core expansion*, *secondary expansion*, *core reconfiguration*, and *secondary reconfiguration*.

## Toolkit 4: Service innovation B: Crafting and delivering world-class services

- Learn how to create top-quality services
- Understand and meet customer expectations better
- Identify and fix gaps in your service delivery

Services are 75% of the U.S. economy. Sadly, the bulk of innovation and strategy thinking is focused on products. This toolkit emphasizes the importance of services in creating competitive advantage and customer value. We will advise on six approaches a company can adopt to craft and deliver world-class services. We will also cover the GAPS model, which can help companies bridge the gap between what customers expect and what they think they received. We will train managers to bridge that gap by focusing on four strategic sub-gaps---the Knowledge gap, the Standards gap, the Delivery gap, and the Communications gap. We will also train managers to apply the GAPS model self-assessment toolkit to systematically unearth and address the service gaps in their business model.

## Toolkit 5: Macroinnovation: Learning to systematically think out-of-the-box

- Reimagine your entire business model
- Focus on what customers really need
- Set your company apart from competitors

This toolkit is ideal for business model innovation. This powerful toolkit provides a graphical, storytelling approach to recrafting a company's business model. It makes sure that top management does not miss the forest for the trees. Using the concept of value curve thinking, we will partner with management to distill a customer-focused business model by wading through four questions: What do our customers [really] need? Where are we right now? Where is our key competition? Where do we want to be?

## Toolkit 6: Green innovation: Building environmentally sustainable organizations

- Make your business more environmentally friendly
- Find ways to be both "green" and profitable
- Appeal to customers who care about sustainability

Building environmentally sustainable business models is a priority for all companies in the modern environment, where companies are expected to report and show progress on sustainability goals and metrics. The corporate world has historically seen this as a weight around the neck---something to be done at the minimal level that passes scrutiny. However, companies are under increasing pressure to take this responsibility seriously. In addition, foresightful companies are realizing that there is a promising intersection between "green" and "gold." We embrace this intersection in this toolkit, using which we train managers to build profitable value chains that are more sustainable from end-to-end. As an aside, this kind of thinking is valuable for every firm in the PE portfolio.

## Toolkit 7: Systematic brainstorming skills

- Make your team's idea sessions more productive
- Learn to solve problems more effectively as a group
- Generate better ideas through improved teamwork

Managers often walk away from a brainstorming session more confused than when they walked in. This is because managers don't usually engage in systematic brainstorming. Applying this toolkit, managers can master the group brainstorming process by making every problem-solving session integrate more open listening, more innovative thinking, sequential problem breakdown-resolution-integration---and more fun.

## Toolkit 8: Value management (and pricing) innovation

- Set the right prices for your products or services
- Understand the true value you offer to customers
- Equip your sales team to explain your pricing better

Pricing is the moment of truth for the corporate world. Price is the only variable that converts everything a company does to create value back into profits. Getting pricing wrong can put a lot of money, time and effort to waste---and yet, pricing is often treated much like an afterthought in the context of strategy. But to get pricing right, managers need to get the underlying calculus of value management right. Using this toolkit, we will advise managers about (a) How to use the NPV approach to rigorously compute the value delivered to business customers; (b) How to use a Second Price Sealed Bid Auction (or Vickrey Auction) approach to rigorously compute the value delivered to individual consumers; (c) How to set the optimal price based on the calculated delivered value; (d) How to map the functional, economic, and psychological value elements to different stakeholders: The Value-Stakeholder Mapping Matrix. Using the toolkit, we will guide managers to ensure that there is no value left uncommunicated to customers on the table---that also creates a powerful tool for the salesforce.

## Toolkit 9: Innovative value framing

- Make your products or services seem more valuable to customers
- Improve profits without major new investments
- Learn psychological techniques for better pricing

For decades, companies have been fixated on economic perceptions of value. However, behavioral approaches have demonstrated that the psychology of value can matter---a whole lot. With this toolkit, we will work with managers to rethink their market-facing offerings in the context of pricing, product line presentation, perceived inventory availability, and other dimensions to enhance customer perceptions of delivered value. With limited investment, these strategies can substantially elevate the value perceived by customers, creating room for higher prices and profits.

## Toolkit 10: Managing disruptive innovation

- Protect your business from new, game-changing competitors
- Learn how to be a game-changer in your industry
- Spot opportunities for creating new markets

Understanding and managing the "attack from below" is important in today's markets. Transistor radios disrupted huge vacuum tube-based radios at a fraction of their price, thereby opening up a whole new market. Honda and Toyota disrupted the U.S. marketplace that was filled with big, boat-like cars with their cheap and cheery (and initi
