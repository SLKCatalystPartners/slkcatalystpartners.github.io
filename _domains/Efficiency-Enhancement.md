Optimizing resource use, improving processes, stopping unproductive activities, and introducing new, effective strategies.

# Maximizing Resource Utilization

- Innovate within existing resource constraints to maximize efficiency.
- Identify and stop unproductive activities to streamline operations.
- Challenge current processes and implement effective changes.
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement and resource optimization.
- Implement leaner and more efficient organizational structures.

## Toolkit 11: Constrained innovation: Learning to systematically think "inside-the-box"

- Improve your business without spending more money
- Find creative ways to use existing resources better
- Make your organization leaner and more efficient

The word "innovation" almost reflexively invokes the specter of additional money and other resources. But most managers overlook the fact that one of the most effective ways to innovate is to do more with less...to work with what we already have. We will work with managers to apply five different approaches to thinking inside-the-box. The end result should be a leaner, simpler, more efficient organization.

## Toolkit 12: The Stop-Change-Start framework

- Identify and stop unnecessary activities in your business
- Find better ways to achieve important outcomes
- Discover new activities that can improve your business

One of the most powerful, but also most overlooked, ways to innovate is to stop doing things. Stopping doing things clears the table and mind, and frees up resources for doing things differently. We will lead managers systematically through what needs to be stopped in their business (the "stop"). We will then cover areas where certain outcomes are still needed but the "how" needs to be challenged (the "change"). Finally, we will discuss what needs to be started (the "start"). But the stop, change, and start are not watertight compartments. We will sensitize managers to how they should think holistically about this framework and how they can apply it regularly with their teams to make sure the business remains at the cutting edge and avoids collecting driftwood.
