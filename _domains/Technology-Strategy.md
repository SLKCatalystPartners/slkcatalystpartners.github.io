Incorporating technology into all business aspects, enhancing digital strategies, and driving technology adoption.

# Harnessing Technology for Advantage

- Integrate technology seamlessly into market strategies for competitive advantage.
- Develop strong peripheral vision to identify opportunities and threats.
- Drive technology adoption and overcome barriers to innovation.
- Reimagine products and services to leverage digital advancements.
- Craft comprehensive digital marketing strategies aligned with overall goals.

## Toolkit 13: Integrating technology into market strategy

- Improve your market strategy using technology
- Understand how technology affects your customers and competitors
- Use technology to enhance your products, pricing, and marketing

Market strategy involves deeply understanding the key players, deciding on a robust segmentation, targeting and positioning strategy, and then developing a marketing mix that supports the chosen positioning. Here, we will work with managers to understand how technology affects every aspect of the market strategy and how it can be put to work to enhance the market strategy:

- How technology affects the 3 Cs: the Company, Customers, and Competitors
- How technology affects STP: Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning decisions
- How technology affects the Marketing Mix (4 Ps): Product, Price, Place/Distribution and Promotion/Branding decisions

## Toolkit 14: Developing a strong peripheral vision in a technology-intensive environment

- Spot new opportunities and threats early
- Improve your organization's ability to adapt to change
- Build better routines for scanning your business environment

Many of the most appealing opportunities and lurking threats now exist in the organization's periphery and not in its focal vision. This makes many organizations vulnerable because they lack an expansive peripheral vision. We work with managers to apply 12 approaches to actively scan and analyze their organization's periphery, delineating the opportunities and ferreting out the threats. We also provide insights into building personal, team, and organizational routines and initiatives that increase the sustained ability to scan the periphery often and well.

## Toolkit 15: Driving technology adoption

- Increase customer acceptance of your new products
- Overcome barriers that prevent customers from trying new things
- Understand how new products spread in the market

To drive the adoption and take-up of new products in the marketplace, the market must be analyzed as a social system. We will advise on how managers can systematically dismantle the barriers to adoption. Specific approaches will involve working through Roger's six innovation adoption barriers, conquering Moore's "technology chasm," and understanding the Bass model of technology diffusion.

## Toolkit 16: Creating end-to-end technology intensive value chains

- Improve every stage of your business with technology
- Increase your company's efficiency and competitive advantage
- Generate new ideas for using technology throughout your business

Today, every company is a technology company. But companies need to proactively integrate technology into every stage of the value creation and delivery process. Doing so well can help create competitive advantage, increase efficiency, and increase scalability and profits. However, most companies lack a systematic approach to such an integration of technology. We will work with managers to map the value chain into stages using 15 questions. We will then ask 4 challenging questions at each stage, ultimately culminating in a framework of 60 questions that can help generate an inventory of valuable ideas for building out a technology-intensive value chain---and company.

## Toolkit 17: Reimagining products in the digital age

- Rethink your products for the digital world
- Find new ways to add value using technology
- Explore new business models enabled by digital technologies

Companies need to fundamentally rethink products in the age of technology. We will work with managers to access opportunities to incorporate digital technologies within the "boundary" of the product, and also at the product's interfaces with the user, the supplier, and the network. Sometimes, rethinking the offering along these dimensions can yield a different, more profitable business model, including outcome-based pricing for industrial products.

## Toolkit 18: Driving innovation over the technology lifecycle

- Maximize profits throughout your product's life
- Find new ways to innovate at every stage of your product's lifecycle
- Develop a plan for continuous innovation

In many companies, innovation tends to be concentrated at the front end of product development and launch. Instead, companies must engage in different kinds of innovation at every stage of the product and technology lifecycle, from the day the product is launched to the day it is completely withdrawn from the market. This proactive approach will maximize product profits across the lifecycle. We will work with managers to develop a proactive plan for such life-cycle innovation.

## Toolkit 19: Influencing customers in the digital environment

- Understand and influence customer behavior online
- Improve your company's online presence and strategy
- Manage multiple sales channels effectively

Customer behavior is rapidly morphing in the digital environment. We will advise managers on how to analyze customers in the emerging environment, and how to influence them. A key focus will be the management of the omnichannel organization, which is often executed in a sub-optimal way. We will help managers address challenges related to the overall goals, organizational structure and incentives, and process integration that must be addressed for an omnichannel strategy to be successful.

## Toolkit 20: Crafting a comprehensive digital marketing strategy

- Develop a complete online marketing plan
- Align your digital marketing with your overall strategy
- Improve your search engine rankings and online advertising

Many companies discuss digital marketing on a stand-alone basis. We will begin by emphasizing the importance of aligning the digital marketing strategy with the overall marketing strategy. Following that, we will work with managers through a multi-step digital marketing strategy formulation and execution approach:

- Get the Marketing Map (3 Cs, STP, 4 Ps) right in the digital context
- Revisit the customer and the brand in the digital context (Same or different?)
- Set meaningful and measurable goals for the digital marketing campaign
- Design an influencer strategy
- Engage in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to enhance Organic Search performance
- Manage the market for Paid Search (Digital advertising)

## Toolkit 21: Integrating AI into strategy development

- Use AI to improve your business strategy
- Save time and costs in strategy development
- Identify new opportunities using AI-powered analysis

AI platforms can play a key role in market-focused strategy development, from detailed product-related innovation and concept development to analyzing growth opportunities and customer segmentation strategies. However, managers must learn to integrate AI into their own thinking and planning to make the best use of it. Doing so well will save substantial time, effort, and costs and increase the likelihood of success. Doing so poorly and/or not recognizing when AI is simply off the mark can lead to bad decisions. We will work with managers to integrate AI platforms deeply into the strategy formulation process, highlighting specific areas where AI can make a substantial difference.
