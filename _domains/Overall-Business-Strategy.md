Defining organizational vision, managing communications, aligning metrics with strategy, navigating global markets, and managing risks and changes.

# Comprehensive Strategic Vision

- Define and communicate a clear organizational vision and mission.
- Optimize corporate communications across all stakeholder interfaces.
- Align business metrics with strategic goals and performance indicators.
- Navigate global and developing markets with customized strategies.
- Mitigate risks and manage change effectively within the organization.

## Toolkit 27: Crafting organizational vision

- Create a clear, inspiring vision for your company
- Align your team around common goals and values
- Set ambitious but achievable long-term objectives

The organizational vision is the lighthouse in stormy seas---an always-clear benchmark you navigate by. Often companies jump into the strategy formulation and execution stage without carving out the vision. This is a mistake because, in the absence of a clear vision, strategy can meander over time. We will work with managers systematically through the four-step of carving out the organizational vision---demarcating the core values, articulating the mission or core purpose, laying out some big, hairy, audacious goals (BHAGs), and creating a vivid description of the imagined future.

## Toolkit 28: Managing corporate communications strategically

- Improve communication with customers, employees, and society
- Develop a comprehensive communication plan for your company
- Build a lean, effective communication structure in your organization

We will work with managers on optimizing corporate communications in the new era:

- Learning how to optimize corporate communications across the four stakeholder interfaces (customers, customer communities, society and employees) in the age of four disruptive priorities (growing technology-intensity, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and rising uncertainty)---this leads to a communication plan across 16 domains.
- Building out lean organizational structures and skillsets to support new era corporate communications

## Toolkit 29: Business metrics

- Align your strategy, people, and execution through effective metrics
- Measure and improve key aspects of your business performance
- Design better compensation and performance measurement systems

We are champions of embedding strategy execution planning within the strategy planning process itself. This addresses the fact that too many companies spend too much time thinking about what to do, and too little time thinking about how to get that done. Here we will coach managers on some combination of the following areas:

- Using metrics to align strategy, people, and execution
- The Balanced Scorecard
- High-level vision-related metrics
- Innovation metrics
- Environmental and social sustainability metrics including ESG metrics
- Customer-focused and market-focused metrics
- Brand metrics
- Managing people: Optimal compensation design and performance measurement

## Toolkit 30: Entering and managing global and developing markets

- Expand your business into new countries successfully
- Understand and adapt to different cultural business environments
- Develop strategies for emerging markets

Understanding how national cultures vary is critical to designing a business strategy with a specific country. We will train managers to apply Hofstede's National Cultures framework, so they can benchmark how a country's culture differs from that of the United States. Understanding how national cultures vary can strongly influence managerial and customer behaviors. Equipped with this framework, managers can hit the ground running in a foreign culture, both interacting with managers and partners more effectively and designing a business and market strategy that is customized to the local market. Further, we will apply concepts such as frugal innovation to embrace a different mindset while entering and managing developing markets.

## Toolkit 31: Managing the risk associated with business initiatives

- Identify and mitigate risks in your business
- Develop strategies to handle uncertainties in technology and markets
- Protect your business from various types of risks

Business involves risk, but today's marketplaces involve a heightened degree of risk on account of uncertainties related to technological evolution, geopolitics, social unrest, and other areas. Managers must pursue risk mitigation initiatives across the board, systematically thinking about the sources of risk and about how to mitigate them. We will work with managers to apply the Risk-Mitigation Matrix, which lays out specific initiatives managers can adopt to reduce business risk in nine market-facing activity areas.

## Toolkit 32: Change management

- Lead successful organizational changes
- Overcome resistance to change in your company
- Create a more flexible and adaptable organization

To be resilient and flexible in today's uncertain environments, managers need to be strong at embracing---and driving---change. But this is easier said than done because most humans tend to naturally resist change. We will train managers to be effective change leaders by leading them through the GAPS model of change management. Using this model, managers will assess the key areas related to Vision gap, the People gap, the Process gap, and the Communications gap that need to be addressed within the organization, in order to facilitate change. Following that, we will examine how we can dismantle the barriers in the areas of Motivation, Opportunity, and Ability that stand in the way of change. We will also learn lessons from how leaders across history have led change. Finally, based on the gained insights, we will guide managers in developing a short-term and medium-term plan for making the organization more capable of embracing and driving change.
