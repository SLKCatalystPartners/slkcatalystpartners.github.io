## Our Approach

SLK Catalyst Partners specializes in working with Private Equity (PE) firms to develop strategies for their portfolio companies. We partner at an early stage with PE firms and their portfolio companies to prevent sub-optimal outcomes and ensure strategically sound and quick starts on both demand and supply sides.

## Why We Exist

We address a critical gap in the PE investment process:

- PE investment theses are often based on limited information
- Due diligence is largely backward-looking
- Value creation plans often start on the back foot
- There's typically misalignment between company management strategy and PE investment thesis

Our goal is to create a well-defined and documented growth and profit trajectory that brings accountability from day one, reduces mid-hold period hiccups, and makes future exits more appealing.

## How We Work

1. **Research**: We conduct thorough research, including "boots on the ground" fieldwork, to understand the company and its market environment.

2. **Develop**: We apply our rich portfolio of intellectually rigorous and road-tested toolkits to develop strategies across five key domains:
   - Innovation and Growth Strategy
   - Efficiency Enhancement
   - Technology Strategy
   - Market-based Strategy
   - Overall Business Strategy

3. **Deliver**: We provide two key deliverables:
   - A tangible strategy with clearly defined initiatives and execution plans
   - Enhanced ability for company management to apply and execute the toolkits

4. **Execute**: As an option, we can work with the company through the execution stage via SLKone.

## Our Focus

We primarily focus on small to mid-size PE firms because:

- Substantial opportunities exist due to strategic maturity gaps
- Rapid results are achievable
- We're passionate about growing businesses in terms of market scope, depth, and profitability
