In today’s challenging market environment, private equity (PE) sponsors are facing increasing pressure. Traditional exit strategies have been obstructed by sluggish deal activity, and the creative tactics firms are deploying—such as continuation funds and asset-shuffling—are no longer producing the results they once did. According to a recent article published in Bloomberg, these financial engineering solutions are losing favor with institutional investors who see them as delaying the inevitable rather than enhancing returns (Private Equity Gets Cre…).
So, what’s the alternative for PE sponsors looking to maximize returns while satisfying investor expectations? The key lies in proactively accelerating value creation, rather than relying on market timing or tactical restructuring. This is where SLK Catalyst Partners steps in with a unique approach, offering a clear roadmap that can significantly enhance the [future value of portfolio companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/private-equity-gets-creative-to-buy-time-for-more-gains-clients-say-pay-me-now).

### The Reality: PE Portfolio Managers Hold Times Have Lengthened
Small to Mid-Size Private Equity has been the primary feeder to the Mergers and Acquisition (M&A) engine. Acquiring family-owned businesses, professionalizing them, and scaling them up with rapid add-ons through 4-5 years of hold, and flipping them to larger PE sponsors has been a successful playbook. Ample availability of cheap debt has been the engine driving the M&A activity. However, rising costs of capital, geopolitical uncertainties, inflationary pressures, and fears of recessions have driven potential strategic and upper tier PE buyers to the sidelines. Consequently, the hold periods have stretched longer beyond what the portfolio managers had modeled in their investment theses. Paradoxically, larger PE firms are sitting on more than $2 trillion of undeployed capital as they wait to cherry pick the gems.

### The Market Reality: Investors Are Running Out of Patience
The traditional continuation fund model—a common exit route for struggling assets—has grown increasingly unpopular. In fact, only about a third of continuation funds that are initiated ever reach completion today, down from nearly 80% just a few years ago. Investors are becoming more critical of the underlying assumptions driving these deals, especially when faced with the prospect of extending their commitment by several more years, often with little promise of substantial gains. 
Investors now expect more than just financial engineering; they want genuine value creation. They are increasingly questioning whether simply moving assets from one pocket to another is a worthwhile strategy. They’re demanding more transparency, better alignment of interests, and clearer conflict resolutions from fund managers.
