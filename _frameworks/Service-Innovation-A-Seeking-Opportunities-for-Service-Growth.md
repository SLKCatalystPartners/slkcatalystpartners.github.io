- Explores service growth through understanding customer needs and activities.
- Advises on adding new service activities to provide customer value.
- Offers guidance on expanding and reconfiguring core and secondary services.

This framework offers a way to seek service growth through the lens of customer needs and the activities they undertake to address those needs. To address their needs, customers typically engage in activities related to a core activity chain (e.g., finding a home to buy) and secondary activity chains (e.g., financing the home). Service expansion involves adding new service activities that add customer value. Service reconfiguration involves taking over activities that customers do and doing it for them better than they can themselves. Depending on the locus of the service growth, we will advise on growth initiatives in four domainsâ€”core expansion, secondary expansion, core reconfiguration, and secondary reconfiguration.
