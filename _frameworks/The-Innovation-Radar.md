- Teaches managers to systematically explore different dimensions of innovation.
- Helps identify a mix of low-hanging and ambitious ideas for execution.
- Ensures no high-ROI opportunities are overlooked.

This framework focuses on understanding the different “kinds” of innovation. By systematically considering each dimension of innovation, managers can generate an inventory comprising a mix of low-hanging and more ambitious ideas for execution. Apart from surfacing some interesting and usable ideas for long-term growth, applying this framework systematically ensures that no easy, high-ROI opportunities along any of the 12 dimensions of innovation are overlooked.
